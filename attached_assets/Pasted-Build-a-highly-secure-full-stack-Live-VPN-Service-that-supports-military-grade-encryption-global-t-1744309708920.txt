Build a highly secure, full-stack Live VPN Service that supports military-grade encryption, global tunneling, and real-time connection switching. It should include multi-protocol support (OpenVPN, WireGuard, Shadowsocks), client apps (web + desktop + mobile), a real-time dashboard, kill-switch, and obfuscation for bypassing firewalls in restricted regions. Designed for performance, privacy, and security — with a scalable backend, usage monitoring, and subscription-based access.
